"Core.Mateo.JojaBegin": "I can't believe Joja's tearing down the Community Center, those capitalist traitors.$11#$b#Letting them step over small communities like this is exactly how they continue to grow.$9",

"Core.Mateo.MovieTheater": "Wanna go see a flick, @? It's my treat, since you're the one who went through all the trouble to rebuild from those ruins.$1#$b#Nothing does your arteries as good as an evening full of Flavacol popcorn!$32",

// BIRTHDAYS
"Core.Mateo.Winter12": "It's Gunther's birthday today. He's the type that I have no clue how to buy for...$34#$b#What do you get the type of guy who gets himself everything? His 'to be read' list is a mile long.$21",
"Core.Mateo.Winter19": "It's Marlon's birthday today! I have no idea what the old man would want.$8#$b#He's got access to all the best gear, so maybe something to help maintain it... maybe I'll just make him a nice dinner.$32",

// END OF SEASON
"Core.Mateo.SpringEnd":"Spring's over and done with already, huh? Did you have a productive open to the year?$1#$b#Guess you'll be busy preparing the fields for Summer, huh?$14",

"Core.Mateo.CommunityCenter10": "Good to see you here, @. Just doing the rounds and catching up with everyone.$14#$b#Sometimes it's hard to make time to see your friends, so I'm glad the townsfolk are committed to gathering together like this once a season.$1",

"Core.Mateo.FlowerDance": "I love dancing, actually. I was big into the club scene back in college, but -$12#$b#Well, that's a very different sort of dancing, usually with a lot more liquor.$13",
"Core.Mateo.Luau": "I really appreciate the sentiment of the luau - tradition is a really important thing, of course -$10#$b#But doesn't it just seem really short sighted to blindly throw a ton of different things into one soup? I love taking risks, but that seems a little much.$9",
"Core.Mateo.MoonlightJelly": "Tomorrow's celebration is my second favorite, next to Spirit's Eve.$0#$b#I can see the Jellies from the cove. It's breathtaking.$12",
"Core.Mateo.SDVFair":"The fair is tomorrow, @! Are you going to bring pumpkins?$11#$b#And...Other...important...produce?$21#$b#I'm just saying, if I was voting and it was all pumpkins, you'd win.$15",
"Core.Mateo.SpiritsEve": "So, there are a few rules to be followed on Spirit's Eve, back from when I was a kid.$19#$b#One, always check your candy. Two, always wear a costume. Three, always have treats on hand to give out.$11#$b#Finally, never blow out a Jack o' Lantern before midnight. That's the most important one.$19",
"Core.Mateo.IceFestival": "Festival of Ice tomorrow, huh?$14#$b#I'm not one for fishing, by any means. But I can throw a mean snowball - and, hey, if you can dodge an Iridium Bat...$15",
"Core.Mateo.NightMarket": "Oh, that's right. The Night Market's going on.$3#$b#I forgot. Maybe I'll stop by and see if they've got anything from Gotoro for sale. Someone's bound to have smuggled in something interesting, huh?$36",
"Core.Mateo.WinterStar": "There's so much pressure for the Feast of the Winter Star.$22#$b#I don't know what to get anyone! Except you, Marlon and Gunther... Guess it's not just the gifts, but the spirit of the season.$23",

"Core.Mateo.GiveFlowersB":"Damn, @. You beat me to it.$30#$b#Of course I'll be yours, as long as you're mine just the same.$31#$b#Thank you, Sunshine. I haven't felt like this in... well, in a really long time.$4",

"Core.Mateo.StardropGiftB":"Morning, Sunshine! You won't believe what I found in the Skull Cave.$1#$b#I know it'll put an extra pep in your step, and you work so hard - you deserve it.$32#$b#Have an amazing day, okay?$11#$b#%Mateo leans forward and kisses your forehead.",

"Core.Mateo.DumpedGirls": "Guess you aren't the person I thought you were, @.$8#$b#I expected better. Everyone's got their baggage. I just refuse to carry it for you.$9",
"Core.Mateo.SecondChanceGirls":"...Consider yourself lucky I don't easily let go of what's mine, @.$4#$b#Just don't mess it up again, alright? My heart can only take so much.$28",
"Core.Mateo.Reject2HA": "No thanks, farmer. I don't want the town coming after you with torches and pitchforks.$24",
"Core.Mateo.Reject2HB":"Farmer, do you know what a bad idea looks like? This, it looks like this right here.$10",
"Core.Mateo.Reject4HA":"@, I appreciate this, and I appreciate you, but it's a no for now - I have to work on myself first.$21",
"Core.Mateo.Reject4HB":"Sorry, @. I can't. It'll be a mess for the both of us. I'm not ready for a relationship and the last thing I want to do is hurt my closest friend.$16", 
"Core.Mateo.EngageA":"...Aren't you betrothed? I'm not into this. And I didn't think you were the disingenuous sort.$34",
"Core.Mateo.EngageB":"Your wedding is in a few days, and this is how you're acting? I should tell your spouse, lest you break their heart.$22",
"Core.Mateo.MarriedA":"This kind of stuff comes back around to haunt you, @. What comes around goes around. Your spouse deserves better.$23",
"Core.Mateo.MarriedB":"The hell is wrong with you, @? Your partner deserves better. I didn't expect a cheater out of you.$33",
"Core.Mateo.RefusalNoHeartsA":"The mermaid pendant tradition goes back centuries. Good for whoever you're giving it to.$32",
"Core.Mateo.RefusalNoHeartsB":"We had a pretty different tradition in the Fern Islands. This is very cute, though - good luck!$32",
"Core.Mateo.RefusalKnownA":"This would be cute if it wasn't so weird. Thanks but no thanks, I guess?$34",
"Core.Mateo.RefusalKnownB":"You're really looking to get into some trouble, huh? I'm flattered, sort of. But no.$37",
"Core.Mateo.RefusalBotherA":"It wasn't funny or cute the first time, what makes you think this is any better?$22",
"Core.Mateo.RefusalBotherB":"Cut it out, @. It takes a lot to get here but you're crossing a line into making me uncomfortable.$23",

// RESORT
"Core.Mateo.ResortEntering":"This place is amazing! It makes me feel like I'm back in the Fern Islands. Man, how nostalgic.$1",
"Core.Mateo.ResortLeaving":"Today was a good day, but I've had my fill. Nothing beats a post-beach shower. Gotta wash all the sunscreen off.$0",
"Core.Mateo.ResortShore":"I've visited a lot of different islands, @. But one thing to keep in mind: all of them share the same sky.$4",
"Core.Mateo.ResortUmbrella":"Just taking a little break from running around, @. Be sure to put on some sunscreen if you're going to spend a lot of time out and about.$32",
"Core.Mateo.ResortWander":"I know I live on a beach, but there's still something special about visiting a different one.$1",
"Core.Mateo.ResortWander.2":"I need a good pair of sunglasses. The big ones, that the bougie city girls wear.$35",
"Core.Mateo.ResortChair":"I could probably fall asleep here, but I snooze like a rock and I'd probably miss the boat back.$6",
"Core.Mateo.ResortBar":"We should toast to your hard work, @. Without you, this wouldn't have been set up.$12",
"Core.Mateo.ResortTowel":"%Mateo seems completely relaxed.", 
"Core.Mateo.ResortTowel.2":"I spent many a day in college drinking at the beach instead of writing papers...$15",
"Core.Mateo.Resort_Towel.3":"This would be a great place to have a party.$13",
"Core.Mateo.Resort":"Did you build a house here, @? A home away from home. Nice!$1",

// ADDITIONAL LOCATIONAL DIALOGUE
"Core.Mateo.Saloon.4h":"It's so nice to be back here, @. I love being around people. Everyone's so jovial and it's so easy to feel relaxed right alongside them. I feel welcome, and whole.$4",
"Core.Mateo.Saloon.6h": "I love spending time here because it's a great way to see everyone at once. People watching is a lot of fun...$0#$b#Demetrius has two left feet, and Marnie is way too good for Lewis. I wish Marlon would work up the courage to make a move.$36",
"Core.Mateo.Saloon.8h":"There's no better way to spend an evening than among friends. I'm so glad you convinced me it was worth re-integrating, @. I love hanging out with everyone.$12#$b#I owe you a drink. Hell, I owe you a few.$14",
"Core.Mateo.Saloon.10h.Platonic":"Hey, @. How about you and I hang out a while? You probably need some r&r after a long day. Some time to rest is earned.$1",
"Core.Mateo.Saloon.10h.Romantic":"Hey, Sunshine. How about you and I have a few drinks and get a little bit slovenly? Thank goodness the farm isn't that far off, if we even make it there.$31",

"Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.4h":"It's so nostalgic in here... it's like spending time in my childhood home.$12#$b#I didn't realize how badly I missed this place until I came back to it.$32",
"Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.6h": "Haven't read for leisure in a really long time, so I'm starting over with some of my favorites.#$b#Having to read for school really sucks the fun out of it.",
"Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.8h":"I love watching everyone come in and out, learning, reading, relaxing. Nothing makes me happier than seeing folks engage with academia.$32#$b#Especially the kids; they're all so eager to learn, and I love that. Bless Penny and her neverending patience.$1",
"Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.10h.Platonic":"I know you're busy @, but a good book is worth making time for. I'm re-reading The Great Gatsbish, it's one of my favorites.$4",
"Core.Mateo.ArchaeologyHouse.10h.Romantic":"I'm re-reading the Great Gatsbish; it's my comfort book. I've always related deeply to it, like it was the script for how my life was supposed to play out, but...$2#$b#Gats got caught in the tide of his own misguided vision, and couldn't row forward. But I don't identify so much with his struggle anymore, because I was able to leave the past where it belonged.$12#$b#That doesn't mean I love the novel any less. But maybe I should start looking for a new favorite.$32",

"Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.4h": "Hail and well met, adventurer! Gosh, that sounds cheesy, doesn't it?$1",
"Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.6h": "Hail and well met, adventurer!$1#$b#Hah, that's really growing on me. Though maybe I should leave the greetings to Marlon.$32",
"Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.8h":"Hey there, @! Hail and well met. Here to get some new equipment? Or maybe offload some old stuff?$36#$b#Marlon's got you covered. Stay safe down below, alright?$32",
"Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.10h.Platonic":"Hey, @, hail and well met. Are you doing a little exploring? Have you got everything you need?$32#$b#Are your weapons taken care of? Just stay safe down there, all right? Be careful.$1",
"Core.Mateo.AdventureGuild.10h.Romantic":"Hail and well met, Sunshine! Have you got everything you need? Are your weapons taken care of?$31#$b#Stay safe if you're heading down into the mines, alright? I love you.$29",

// PLAYER DEATH
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Mines.01": "Sunshine!",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Mines.02": "Sunshine, what happened? I'm so sorry!",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Mines.03": "Please be more careful! Even skilled adventurers like yourself can get seriously hurt!$2#$b#Maybe go home and get some rest before heading back down, okay?$21",
 
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.01": " ...{0}?",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.02": "Easy, now... take it slow.",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.03": "You're awake! Thank goodness. Mateo found you all bent out of shape in the Skull Cave!$2",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.04": "Sunshine!$18#$b#I was so worried, you getting hurt is my worst nightmare!$19",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.05": "Are {{LPPN1}} going to be alright, Harv?$29",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.06": "{{CPPN1}}'ll be fine, but {{LPPN1}}'ll need to be a little more careful next time.$2",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.07": "I'll leave you two to talk; let me know if you need anything.$2",
"Core.Mateo.PlayerKilled.Skull.08": "I was so afraid of losing you, @. I don't know what I'd do without my best friend, the love of my life.$17#$b#Please ask for help if you need it next time, Sunshine! I'd rather be in danger with you than have you go at the Skull Cave alone!$19",

// GREEN RAIN

// SEASONAL EARLY HEART 
// SPRING
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.1": "Hey, farmer. What do you call an emergency in the Spring? May Day.$14",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.2": "It's getting warmer out. You can tell by the Spring in folks' step.$14",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.3": "What do you grow, anyway? Parsnips, potatoes, what else? I'm not the agricultural sort.$0",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.4": "What did the florist say during springtime, @? $1#$b#Business is blooming.$32",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.5": "Watch out, farmer. Wilderness Golems get particularly ornery in the Spring, in the case they turn up on your land.$34#$b#At least they're easier to manage than Stone Golems - there's two types of those, keep an eye out for the sturdier ones. They're bigger, with horns.$9",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.6": "Spring must be really busy for you. Lots of work to do. Be sure to take it easy on occasion, you owe it to yourself.$24",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.7": "Are you a sword, hammer, or dagger sort of person?$0#$b#I'm good with a longsword, but I'm better with a pair of daggers. Be sure to maintenance any weapons you used over the Winter.$1",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.8": "It's a good time of year to look for fossils, if you're interested in that sort of thing. Crabs and frogs, specifically, seem really common around here.$36",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.9": "Hey @! I found this down below, can you get it to Gunther for me? Thanks! [117 118 119 120 110 111 112]$14",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.10": "Some hot chocolate would be great right now. The best I can do in the tent is a hot plate- anything else would be a fire hazard.$16#$b#I don't keep a lot of food in there at a time lest any wild critters break in.$8",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.11": "Hey, farmer. Have a good day today, alright? Keep your chin up.$0",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.12": "Seen anything interesting on your adventures lately, @? I'd love to hear about what you're up to.$0",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.13": "Please excuse my resting beach face, farmer. $15",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.14": "Hey, farmer. Hope you're doing alright. Keep working hard, but not too hard.$1",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.15": "The trader out in the desert has these artifact troves; they've got things like Dwarven Gadgets and other relics inside.$34#$b#I'm not sure how it's all being sourced, though. I know the woman in the traveling cart gets her goods from Gotoro, which is...extremely risky.$37",
"Core.Mateo.Spring.EarlyHeart.16": "Hope you're doing alright since that little encounter with those slimes.$32",

// SUMMER
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.1": "Hey, farmer. It's really humid out... be careful, stay hydrated.$0",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.2": "When the sun pervades through the tent flap in the morning, it's always worth getting up and watching it rise. There's just something about it in the summer that's particularly magical - maybe it's the way the light hits the water.$4",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.3": "Howdy, farmer. Will I sea you on the beach this season?$14",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.4": "It's the best time of the year to go swimming. Be careful, though. If you get scratched up by something in the caves, salt water will just irritate it.$24",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.5": "Frost Bats have trouble surviving in humid temperatures, so you're not likely to see them up on the surface. There's several colonies of regular Fruit Bats in the Valley, though.$12",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.6": "Did you know air conditioning was first used in movie theaters? It's part of the reason we have summertime blockbusters - people go in droves to keep cool.$1",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.7": "I picked a scab from a wound I got fighting monsters. The one downside to wearing an open shirt, I guess. Everyone sees what a mess I make of myself.$8#$b#Some days it bothers me, and some days it doesn't. But it's never enough that I want to wear long sleeves or a closed top in the Summer.$13",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.8": "The Metal Heads that live in the mines are a lucky sort. If they were up on the surface for a Valley summer, they'd boil in their little helmets.$9",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.9": "It's cooler in the mines than it is on the surface right now. Pass this along for me, okay? [96 97 98 99]$14",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.10": "It's cooler in the mines than it is on the surface right now. Pass this along for me, okay? [100 101 103]$14",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.11": "Split a stone and found this - here you go, @! Thanks for getting it to Gunther for me. [110 111 112 117 118 119 120]$14",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.12": "Hey, farmer. What do you say when your fishing line gets tangled? That something a-piers to be wrong.$15",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.13": "When I first started delving as a kid, I was particularly fascinated by the Dust Sprites. Cute little things, aren't they?$12",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.14": "Hey, @. Here's my latest find. Monsters drop the strangest things sometimes, don't they? [113 115 116]$14",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.15": "Hey, @. Here's my latest find. Monsters drop the strangest things sometimes, don't they? [104 105 106]$14",
"Core.Mateo.Summer.EarlyHeart.16": "I want to get more involved in the community, but I haven't worked out how yet. Maybe Marnie needs some help around the ranch.$8",

// FALL
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.1": "Nothing beats a brisk mountain walk in the Fall. Don't you just love that crispness in the air?$4",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.2": "I need a few more pumpkins for the tent... Once you harvest, I might buy a bunch off you.$13",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.3": "I try to minimize how much time I spend down below during this time of year, but I did find this.[96 97 98 99 100 101 103]$14",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.4": "Bet the farm looks amazing this time of year. Lots of sunflowers and pumpkins, right?$12",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.5": "I really love how everything gets gold-toned this time of year. It's so nice to just wander around.$32",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.6": "I could go for some mulled cider right now, or pumpkin spice anything, or apple pie with some ice cream...$36",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.7": "Are you growing sunflowers? Do you cook the seeds? Oh! By the way. I found this, maybe you can donate it. [117 118 119 120]$15",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.8": "It's just a hypothesis, but I'm convinced there's a connection between Spirit's Eve and the various Ghosts that haunt the mines; maybe they come to the surface and cause mischief...$35",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.9": "What do you do with all the pumpkins you grow...? Oh! By the way. I found this, maybe you can donate it. [110 111 112]$14",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.10": "Are you an apple cider person, a pumpkin spice person, or a hot chocolate person? What's your autumnal drink of choice, and why is it pumpkin spice?$36",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.11": "I've traveled a lot, but the season changes aren't nearly as dramatic elsewhere as they are in the Valley. It's one of the things I love about living here. Time moves forward even when you're feeling stuck, and the scenery change is a reminder of that.$1",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.12": "Have you ever seen a Squid Kid? I'm not sure why they're even called that. The little bastards shoot fireballs, so just be careful if you run into them. Take care of yourself when adventuring, @.$32",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.13": "I think the Golden Masks you can occasionally find in the desert are ceremonial versions of the ones worn by Shadow Shamans. I wonder if they lived there at some point in time, or if it's just a weird coincidence.$37",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.14": "If you need to show your sword a little bit of care, go ahead and use mineral oil. Rem oil works, too, which is for sewing machines. That might be a little easier to find locally. Be safe in your adventures, @.$0",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.EarlyHeart.15": "I pulled this up from a Duggy den. And now it's yours! [104 105 106]$15",

"Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.5": "I love walking through the mountains this time of year. It's so pretty, and something is different every time you pass through. The mines don't ever change, so it's easy to feel like you're getting trapped down there if you don't remember to come up for air once in a while.$12#$b#I get so sentimental, and drawn out of my usual routine.

"Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.10": "Getting to bundle up with a fashionable coat is one of my favorite parts of Fall, and the only thing I like about Winter.$10#$b#I'm not very aesthetically forward, but I try to look nice when I can. It's just not a common occurrence - who am I dressing up for, the monsters in the caverns?$11",

"Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.16": "Are you going to bring something to the Spirit's Eve celebration, @? I don't know if they do it here in the Valley, but in more densely populated areas, passing out treats is a really important part of the holiday festivities.$32",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.17": "Don't blow a Jack o' Lantern out before midnight, @. They're to keep away creatures of the night. I think that myth stems all the way back from when we had to contend with monsters on the surface more often.$35#$b#It was a practice to keep them away because we naturally fear the unknown.$36",
"Core.Mateo.Fall.LateHeart.18": "I don't think anyone ever really ages out of Spirit's Eve. It's the one time of year where you can express yourself with a costume, and I think that's good for the soul.$1#$b#It's a tradition that has existed in some form for over a thousand years, across multiple different cultures.

"CT.Gunther.MateoConfrontation": "I hoped for the best, and it would appear that it worked out. Mateo's more well-read than I expected, hardly the criminal a man like Wyatt would've raised them to be.#$b#I think they'll make a fine addition to the academic community; I'm looking forward to whatever contributions they look to make.",
"CT.Gunther.MateoWyatt": "I misjudged Mateo. I'm grateful everything seems to be worked out.",

"CT.Gunther.CGuildConstruction": "I'm working on getting the license paperwork ready for Mateo and Marlon's little project. I understand Mateo's desire to skew towards academics over swordplay after what happened.",
"CT.Gunther.CGuildComplete": "Mateo has grown so much since I've known them. Honestly, I almost wish... they'd fallen under my care all those years ago, instead of ending up with Wyatt.#$b#I feel as though I could've spared them some of the emotional adversity. I...#$b#I wouldn't have let them build all the self-resentment that they did.#$b#Seeing the guild there on the beach felt like... well, quite the fairy-tale ending, didn't it? I was very excited to discuss Mateo's pursuits...#$b#...And then I saw all of the tabletop bits and pieces on the table, and the documentation on the bookshelves...",
"CT.Gunther.MateoDate": "I can't say I'm surprised to see you and Mateo together. Some stories have predictable outcomes, do they not?",
"CT.Gunther.MateoIntegrity": "Mateo borrowed several books for 'a friend' the other day. Who was it, if not you?... I suppose it doesn't matter, they get returned on time.",
"CT.Gunther.MateoDeclaration": "Mateo's pitch for a new research paper was quite impressive. I'm looking forward to their academic pursuits.",

"CT.Pierre.MateoPain": "Mateo stumbled by the other day and I haven't seen them since...$2",
"CT.Pierre.MateoRecovery": "Sounds like Mateo is back from Zuzu, looking a little worse for wear.#$b#I tried to tell Abigail this is why the mines are so dangerous, but she wasn't having any of it.$2",

// CAROLINE
"CT.Caroline.MateoLibrary": "I saw Mateo pass by, but they didn't say anything. They used to be so sociable.$2",
"CT.Caroline.MateoConfrontation": "I had to tell Mateo not to bring their sword inside. We have enough trouble keeping Abigail out of the mines...$2",
"CT.Caroline.MateoRecovery": "Mateo is back from the hospital. I hope Abigail learns something from this...$2",

// GUS
"CT.Gus.MateoLibrary": "Was that Mateo outside the other night? It's been years since they've been around. I'm surprised they didn't stop in. $2",
"CT.Gus.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo's hardly changed a bit. That kid can put down more pumpkin than anyone else I've ever met.$1",
"CT.Gus.MateoAcceptance": "Mateo came by for lunch the other day, and you bet I sent them off with the biggest pumpkin pie I could throw together. $1",
"CT.Gus.MateoPain": "I'm making Mateo a spread of pumpkin desserts for when they get out of the hospital.$0#$b#That'll cheer them right up!",
"CT.Gus.MateoRecovery": "Mateo's back! I knew they'd be alright. Time to go drop off all the snacks I made while they were gone.$1",

// HALEY
"CT.Haley.MateoLibrary": "Someone walked past me with a sword covered in slime! They smelled absolutely disgusting. $3",
"CT.Haley.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo doesn't seem so bad once you get to know them.#$b#I can relate.$2",

// HARVEY
"CT.Harvey.MateoLibrary": "Mateo walked by the other day, sword in hand. It's been quite some time.",
"CT.Harvey.MateoAdmission": "I caught Mateo looking like they'd taken quite a beating. I tried to patch them up, but they ... very politely refused and went on their way. $2",
"CT.Harvey.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo was in my office the other day. They bought tonics and remedies before heading up into the mountains.#$b#It was nice to have someone else to talk to about the difficulties of a PhD program, though I'm surprised they don't call themselves Dr. Luis! They earned it!$1#$b# They're warming up to people again. It's a notable improvement to the state of their mental health.$1",
"CT.Harvey.MateoPain": "I understand you might be a bit worried, @.$2#$b#But Mateo's safely at the hospital getting better treatment than I could give them here in the clinic. They'll be okay - just give them some time.$0",
"CT.Harvey.MateoRecovery": "I checked up on Mateo as soon as they got back to town. They've recovered brilliantly, considering how bad the damage was.$1#$b#I'm no... adventurer, but I feel like that sort of encounter would've ended much more poorly for an ordinary person.$2",

// ROBIN
"CT.Robin.MateoAdmission": "Mateo stopped by the other day on their way to the mines! It was so nice to see them. $1",
"CT.Robin.MateoAcceptance": "Is Mateo going to live in that tent on the beach forever? I should help them...$2",
"CT.Robin.CGuildConstruction": "Thanks for helping with the guild, @!$1 It's a big project, but I'm excited for it.",
"CT.Robin.CGuildComplete": "I'm very proud of how the guild looks. Some of my best work! I'm not sure what Mateo wanted the trapdoor on the roof for, though.$1",

// WILLY
"CT.Willy.MateoAdmission": "Ol' Mateo was on the pier the other day. I haven't seen that kid in years. They look like they've come around just fine. $1",
"CT.Willy.MateoConfrontation": "Lil' ol Matty got so big since I last saw 'em. They may have learned their way around a sword, but they couldn't handle a fishing rod to save their lives. $1",

// LEWIS
"CT.Lewis.MateoLibrary": "Mateo's living in East Scarp, I hear. Why didn't they let me know they were coming home?... $2",
"CT.Lewis.MateoConfrontation": "Mateo was all smiles the other day. They cut through the square instead of crossing the bridge and heading north, and they waved at Marnie and I. $1",
"CT.Lewis.MateoPain": "Mateo's at the hospital... I hope this discourages people from going too far into the mines.#$b#...I'm worried about them.$2",
"CT.Lewis.MateoRecovery": "Sounds like Mateo is right as rain and ready to cause trouble like they always have!$1",
"CT.Lewis.CGuildConstruction": "Robin's building a place for Mateo? About time!$1",
"CT.Lewis.CGuildComplete": "Wait a second, they built another guild branch? I didn't authorize this.$3#$b#I suppose it makes sense to have a branch of the guild a little closer to home. Besides, there's that old mine that collapsed... and we don't know what's in there.$2",

"CT.Marnie.MateoRecovery": "I caught Mateo having picked the barn door lock to come and visit the livestock, so it seems they've made a full recovery!$1",

"Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.9": "It feels like I stopped doing music professionally, and then suddenly, and without warning, I got hit with a rush of musical inspiration.$22#$b#It's great. I play so much more NOW than I did prior! I thought I'd lose interest, but I think I just needed a break.$1",
"Core.Cirrus.LionsMane.10": "After the Lion's Mane was built, I thought I'd step back from music.
